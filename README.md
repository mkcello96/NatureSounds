NatureSounds (WITH README)
============

NatureSounds takes advantage of the javax.sound library to play .wav files within the current directory (I
like to use it with nature sounds). Using a java queue, the audio files are lined up and played one by one,
the time of switch determined by the user.

A jPanel allows the user to press a button, which in turn causes the files to rotate. The program 
continues until the jPanel is exited. 


Personally, I'll be using this app to play background nature sounds in my room, but I'm sure there are many
other possibilities.

Also, I've made a NatureSounds.exe file. Make sure there are .wav files in the same directory as this file when
running it.
